# 👨‍💻 About me

Hi I’m Fabio,

I’m here to make people happy, one line of code at a time. 
In my previous life I worked for a double Michelin star restaurant; I loved to see people enjoying the food I made. 

During this time I also learned what it means to lead a team and to consistently deliver high quality food, with extreme attention to details for very high demanding customers. 

In my current life I’m looking to do the same but digitally, because we live in a world where apps can have a huge impact on people’s lives.
