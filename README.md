### 👨‍💻 About me

Hello I’m Fabio,
I’m here to make people happy, one line of code at the time.

In my previous life I worked for a double Michelin start restaurant; I loved to see people enjoying the food I made.
I have also learned what it means to lead a team and to consistently deliver high quality food, with extreme attention to details for very high demanding customers.

In my current life I’m looking to do the same but in digital, because we live in a world where apps can have huge impact on people’s lives.
